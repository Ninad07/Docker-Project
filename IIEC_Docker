Hello
I have created a YAML file to solve the problem of configuring PHP, its database (usually MySQL) and required softwares such as XAMPP for Linux users.
I have commited my OS container and uploaded the image in my repository in Docker hub
For PHP-XAMPP: "docker pull dockerninad07/php_web:1"
For MySQL database: "docker pull mysql:5.7"
