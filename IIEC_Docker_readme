Hello Learners

I have created a Docker compose file, that performs the task of configuring, installing and running Jenkins on the top of Docker.
Jenkins is a DevOps CI/CD tool and an open source automation server which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.
It is normally a Web UI, which stores its data in a database like MySQL.

For that, I have created a persistent volume in Jenkins image by linking it with MySQL Database Server. 
  
  For using the YAML file, you need to pull Jenkins and MySQL:5.7 images from the docker hub.
  On running the compose file, Jenkins will be automatically configured and install.
  Jenkins runs on port 8080
  To launch Jenkins, enter the IP address of the base OS, in my case RedHat 8, in any remote server for example windows, followed by port 8080.
  It will start Jenkins in a few minutes and prompt an initial password.
  Enter the password in the Jenkins page and then you are good to go.

These complex concepts were easily explained to me by Vimal Daga sir.
I would like to thank Vimal sir for launching the IIEC_Rise campaign. His content delivery is so extra ordinary with an essence of proper complete understanding
Once again thanks a lot sir. We owe you a lot.
